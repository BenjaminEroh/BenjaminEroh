<p text align="center"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being born in Nigerian and Migrating to the United states when I was very young, I did not know much about the struggle that numerous African countries face on a day to day basis. In 2005, I took a two-week vacation back to my homeland and realized that the country needed serious help. I experienced the electricity being cutoff for hours or sometimes not being turned for a day or two. The issue with this problem is, that there are very greedy people in the government that would rather fill their own pockets, then helping their own people. I plan to fight and bring change to this issue, by supplying electricity to urban homes that need it the most, for everyday living.</p>
<p text align="center"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are a non-profit organization with one mission, and that is to bring awareness and find a solution to the shortage of electricity reaching the urban areas in Africa. As we are very fortunate in the United States with an abundance of energy that we take for granted every day, urban African homes are lacking and are in dire need. We will continue to grow, with your support of this vision.</p>
